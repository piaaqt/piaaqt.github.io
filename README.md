 **All about Cats !!**

The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. A male cat is called a tom or tomcat or a (gib, if neutered). A female is called a queen or a molly.
